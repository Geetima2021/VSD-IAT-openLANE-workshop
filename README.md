# Overview

This repository is about the workshop conducted by VSD-IAT on advance physical design using the emerging trend of open source EDA tool openLANE and open source pdk sky130. In this workshop VSD provides overall training through interactive tutorials on the fundamentals of physical design as well as hand in experience on the use of the openLANE/sky130 flow . OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII .https://github.com/efabless/openlane.

# Pre requisite
 As for as the workshop is concerned the only requirement is the registered email id. VSD-IAT is an expertly build cloud training platform with zero restriction on   using the platform across all time zones. The workshop design method provides freedom for use of the open source tools on new designs after the workshop https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsd-iat/. 
 
However, for local use of the openLANE tool a set of instructions are to be followed. The initial requirement is an Ubuntu based system with at least 25GB+disk space. This repository https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script gives the detailed instruction for building openLANE into the local system.
 
 # Introduction
 
Verilog RTL is basically a design written in Verilog Language which is a high level language. Either written in behavioral or structural form famously.
GDSII is the database file format which industry follows as a standard format for exchange of data related to IC layout. It is a binary file format representing planar geometric shapes, text labels, and other information about the layout in hierarchical form.
