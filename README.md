# Overview

This repository is about the workshop conducted by VSD-IAT on advance physical design using the new emerging trend of open source tools. As well define in the topic it is based on the openLANE flow using the sky130 pdk. OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII - this capability will be released in the coming weeks with completed SoC design examples that have been sent to SkyWater for fabrication.
